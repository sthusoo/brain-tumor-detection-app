# Brain Tumor Detection <img src="/frontend/public/favicon.ico" alt="drawing" width="30"/>
Brain tumor diagnosis is often performed by examining an MRI due to its high accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. This imaging modality uses non-ionizing radiation to image soft tissues. Specifically, it detects the concentration or density of protons. The whiter areas in an MRI represent regions of high proton density whereas the darker areas represent regions of low proton density (i.e. air, water). Since tumors have high proton density, they show up as a lighter colour.

## Project Overview
Users can upload an image file of a Brain MRI. This image is uploaded to [Firebase Storage](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Once the image is uploaded, users can submit the image where the app will detect whether the patient has a brain tumor. The dataset was taken from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection). This Deep Learnning model uses libraries such as tensorflow, keras, pytorch and performs with an accuracy of 95%+. 

This app is hosted with Firebase Hosting at [Brain Tumor Detection App](https://brain-tumor-detection-aa187.web.app). The api must be run in the backend directory using `python3 api.py`.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

In the 'frontend' directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`
Installs the required node modules.

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm run build`
Creates optimize production build

#### `firebase deploy`
Deploys app to [https://brain-tumor-detection-aa187.web.app](https://brain-tumor-detection-aa187.web.app).

In the 'backend' directory, you can run:

#### `python3 api.py`
Runs the Flask app
